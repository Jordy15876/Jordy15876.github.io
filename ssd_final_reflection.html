									<p>  Throughout this module on safe Software Development, I was introduced to a wide range of concepts and engaged in a variety of hands-on activities that increased my awareness and appreciation for the complexity of developing safe software systems. Each session, from techniques to coding practices, emphasised the significance of developing software that not only works well but also is resilient to security risks. 
                                        This experience has considerably increased my knowledge and provided me with the practical skills required to use safe software development principles. During the first three weeks of the module, I reviewed fundamental concepts like as Waterfall and Agile processes, the Unified Modelling Language (UML), and industry-standard security protocols. While I had covered these ideas in earlier modules, this time I focused on how they apply to secure software development.
                                        It was particularly interesting to examine how different development approaches address security concerns at various phases of the software life cycle.
                                        For example, in Waterfall, a more traditional and sequential approach, security is frequently treated as a final phase, with testing and security analysis performed after the complete product has been produced. On the other hand, Agile's iterative structure emphasises the significance of incorporating security into each cycle. Agile enables developers to adapt to evolving dangers throughout the development process by examining security considerations on a regular basis. 
                                        This contrast helped me understand how important it is to choose the proper technique based on the security requirements of a project.<br>
									<br> Additionally, revisiting UML demonstrated how visual modelling is critical in secure software architecture. UML diagrams are critical tools for helping developers conceptualise and communicate complicated system architectures. Using UML, we can anticipate and detect potential security risks early in the design process, which is significantly more effective than attempting to fix problems later. The modelling approach allows developers to predict how different components will interact and, as a result, how to protect them from potential security threats. 
                                        It also promotes clarity in software architecture, making it easier to examine and audit for security flaws. Moving on to Unit 3, the focus turned to programming languages, specifically Python, 
                                        which was both invigorating and enlightening. I dug deeper into Python's essential concepts, learning about its features and the tools available for debugging and error detection. Python's simplicity and wide range of packages made it a good choice for learning secure coding methods. I saw firsthand the importance of writing code that is clear, efficient, and secure. The hands-on activities gave participants actual experience spotting potential coding bugs and securing code throughout development. 
                                        This course emphasised the vital role that programming languages play in ensuring software integrity and defending systems from vulnerabilities.<br>>
									<br> Units 4 through 6 of the module switched the focus to more in-depth secure coding methods. These lessons emphasised realistic coding strategies for mitigating security vulnerabilities, ensuring that software is not only functional but also secure against a variety of security threats. A substantial amount of these lessons were hands-on Codio activities in which I applied the concepts I had learnt to actual Python code. These activities were quite beneficial because they helped me to discover Python's numerous capabilities and tools for testing code for mistakes and vulnerabilities. 
                                        Cyclomatic Complexity, a metric for measuring code complexity, was one of the most important concepts I learnt. It emphasised the significance of producing simpler, more structured code because increasing complexity makes it more difficult to test, maintain, and secure software. Simplified code is easier to audit and lowers the likelihood of vulnerabilities. In addition, I studied advanced concepts such as recursion and regular expressions (regex), with regex standing out for its security implications. While regex is useful for pattern matching, it can be exploited if not properly handled, 
                                        emphasising the significance of secure coding methods, even for basic concepts.<br>
									<br> Units 7 through 11 included topics such as ontology, API development, and cryptographic programming. While I was new to Ontology and had some experience with APIs, cryptography programming piqued my interest the most. Codio activities gave me thee opportunity to implement RSA tokens and encryption processes, which allowed me to have a practical grasp of safe data transmission. The usage of RSA tokens demonstrated how important public-key cryptography is for authenticating and securing information in secure software development. 
                                        I also learnt about hashing and digital signatures, which highlighted the importance of cryptography in ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. This unit emphasised the critical role that encryption plays in protecting digital communications and systems. <br>
									<br> The summative assignments in this module provided significant learning opportunities. The first assignment was a team effort to generate a design document for a Secure School Management System, emphasising the value of collaboration in software design. The second assignment challenged me to convert that design into a working program, allowing me to utilise the information and abilities I gained during the semester. Despite the hurdles, I was able to complete the job by utilising existing resources. Overall, these tasks were useful and strengthened my knowledge of secure software development. 
                                        Finally, this module, Secure Software Development has greatly improved my understanding of developing secure software systems. By investigating alternative approaches, coding habits, and security standards, I received significant insight into the significance of including security throughout the development process. Hands-on exercises, notably in Python and cryptography, honed my abilities and demonstrated the practical applications of secure coding techniques. The team project taught me the importance of collaboration in software design, preparing me to build resilient software systems in the future. <br>
