                    <p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        This week we were required to read chapter 1-5 of Brooks, P. (1975) 
						The Mythical Man-Month - Essays in Software Engineering. Anniversary ed. Addison-Wesley.This was
						an interesting read and I found the content to be easily digestable. Upon discussion
						with others I found myself echoing a sentiment which was that this book had given
						quite a good idea on how to actually manage a project by partitioning a lot of the
						project task, much of what was discussed in this book is good for a historical and
						learned text but not something one should really put in practice now.
                    </p>
                    <h2><u>Class Discussion</u></h2>

                        I recieved my first reply to the discussion board this week.

					   <h3><u>Group Project</u></h3>
					   <p>
						My group had not met this week but I and a group member had met together on google meet to discuss our role and how effectively we may tackle our responsibilities.
						I came up with an initial budget of the materials that we were supposed to use. Another member cam up with the labour cost.
