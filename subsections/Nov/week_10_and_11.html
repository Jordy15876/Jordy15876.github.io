					<h2><u>Activity</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
						Week 10 dealt with Code Quality and the activity we found ourselves engaing in is one where we had to use 4 different python linters to evaluate the 
						quality of some code. 
						We then had to discuss our thoughts on the different Linters.
						My thoughts on them are as follows:
						When evaluating code quality, the linters used each have a different merit to them. 
						As can be seen when assessing them in this unit, Pylin is the one that is more comprehensive as it allows us to check for a wide range of issues that include style and errors. Pyflakes is much more simple and it focuses on identifying the errors in the code while not giving much attention to style or code quality.
						PyCodestyle also evaluates a code style by checking to see if the code style goes against the recommended python style conventions.
						Lastly PoyDocstyle seems to pay more attention to docstring conventions. 
						All in all each are very useful and I donâ€™t believe is better than the other. I would actually argue that their use depends on the situation you find yourself in.
