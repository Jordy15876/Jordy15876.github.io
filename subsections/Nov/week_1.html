                    <p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        Reading
						The main reading that was required was to read chapters 1-6 of the “Applied Management”
						textbook by Stellman, A. &amp; Greene, J. (2008).
						In these chapters I was given an understanding on how to effectively manage a
						software project as a project manager.
						Chapter 1 gave an introduction on what can be expected what is expected in the role
						of a project manager
						Chapter 2 highlights how important project planning is to the creation of software.
						Project managers must comprehend the needs of stakeholders because urgency
						might result in hurried projects and misunderstandings. The project manager must
						ensure that all parties are in agreement by defining and guiding the project&#39;s scope,
						as the text emphasises. One of the most important instruments for avoiding scope
						conflicts and fostering agreement among stakeholders is the vision and scope
						document. In order to bring the team together and get the project moving in a
						planned direction, the chapter ends by highlighting how crucial it is to review and
						polish the document.
						Chapter 3 speaks to how Estimating software development labour, which is
						sometimes seen as a &quot;black art,&quot; can be made better by following a methodical
						procedure that includes effort estimates, work breakdown structures, and thoroughly
						recorded assumptions. Trust is built during the estimating process by open
						communication and openness, which produces more precise and trustworthy project
						timelines.
						Chapter 4 highlights how Software development labour estimation is sometimes
						seen as a mysterious process. However, it may be improved by using a methodical
						methodology that includes work breakdown structures, effort estimates, and careful
						documentation of assumptions. Since open communication and transparency
						promote confidence among team members and stakeholders, they are essential
						components of this approach. The meticulous application of a work breakdown
						structure guarantees sufficient job definition, which helps to produce precise
						estimations of the amount of work needed for each project component. The
						trustworthiness of the project timeline as a whole is further enhanced by effort
						estimates that are derived from in-depth analysis and past experience. Through
						open communication and recording of assumptions, the team not only spots possible
						obstacles but also lays the groundwork for future reviews and revisions of
						estimations, fostering a more robust and trustworthy estimation process.
						Chapter 5 - The significance of reviews in the software development process is
						covered in Chapter 5. Work products are distributed to reviewers, who then look over
						them, offering insightful commentary and assisting in the early detection of flaws in
						the project. The chapter highlights several review types appropriate for different work
						products and explains how inspections, a popular review type, help prevent defects,
						save money, and transfer knowledge within the project team. It emphasises how
						crucial it is to have a knowledgeable moderator, a carefully selected inspection crew,
						and an honest, productive environment in order to guarantee the efficacy of the
						review process. In response to frequent criticisms of inspections, the chapter

						highlights the benefits of these processes, including time savings, higher-quality job
						output, and the promotion of knowledge sharing among team members.
						Chapter six
						The necessity of obtaining and comprehending software requirements prior to the
						start of the development process is emphasised in Chapter 6. It draws attention to
						the typical mistakes made when developing software without a clear idea of how it
						should operate. Software requirements engineering is introduced in this chapter, with
						a focus on its dual nature as an art and a science. The process of obtaining,
						comprehending, and expressing stakeholder needs—known as requirements
						elicitation—is covered in great detail. This chapter examines a range of elicitation
						techniques, emphasising the use of discussion summaries to verify information
						obtained as well as user observation during work and interviews. It emphasises how
						important it is to fully capture user demands and viewpoints in order to lay the
						groundwork for effective software development.
