					<h2><u>Activity</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
						This week required us to take a look at some old code that we have written and see if we could implement some changes. The code I chose was my original phonebook app that I had created for my first module. In this app I noticed a few flaws that could make it much more polished, these things being:
						Proper comments- I noticed that I had not put that much commentary explaining how my code worked and this can easily lead to some confusion within it.
						Structure â€“ The structure of the code at the time was quite haphazard and was not done in a way which was easily followed. At the time I just rushed to complete it.
						Lastly I decided to incorporate the PyLint tool which I came in contact with during this module. This I found to be quite helpful in picking through some of the errors that I had made.
						
						<h3><u>Project</u></h3>
						<p>
						 I spent some time working on making the cost program of the presentation more comprehensive.
