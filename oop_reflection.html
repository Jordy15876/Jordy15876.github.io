									<p>  Throughout this module, I have obtained a wealth of knowledge in both the theory and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
										Although I had previously been utilizing several OOP concepts such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition in Python, this course 
										introduced me to new and crucial concepts like abstraction and polymorphism, which were entirely unfamiliar to me before.<br>
									<br> The module commenced with a comprehensive introduction to object-oriented programming and its evolution. This foundation was essential, setting the stage for more advanced topics. 
										Following the initial overview, the course delved into System Design and various Unified Modeling Languages (UML). Mastering these two core topics proved to be vital. 
										To implement a system program effectively, one must first craft a robust design, incorporating UML. This creates a roadmap of the system's intended functionality, ensuring the development process remains focused and on track.<br>
									<br> Additionally, this module provided technical skills through the Codio environment, which I found exceptionally beneficial. It was within this interactive platform that I was introduced to advanced OOP techniques such as polymorphism and module importing.
										I have demonstrated the application of these techniques in my ePortfolio across different units, showcasing my ability to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical coding skills.<br>
									<br> The collaborative discussions engaged in throughout this module were also immensely valuable. The first discussion centered around an article by Padhy et al. (2018). 
										This discussion facilitated significant learning for me, as I had the opportunity to present my opinions, read the perspectives of others, and engage in constructive critique. 
										The insights gained from my peers deepened my understanding of OOP concepts, which I now feel confident in applying. <br>
									<br> Although I was unable to participate in the second collaborative discussion due to work commitments, I made it a point to read the provided material and the responses from my classmates. 
										This discussion focused on a metamodel supporting an object-oriented design for the Internet of Things (IoT), specifically for driverless cars. Despite my non-participation, the knowledge gained was invaluable. 
										It provided me with a clearer understanding of how to incorporate IoT elements into my driverless car program, which is due in Unit 11. <br>
									<br>In Unit 3, UML was introduced, reaffirming its importance within the module. The literature provided was comprehensive, offering sufficient knowledge and guiding further exploration of the topic. The various UML diagrams were instrumental in crafting a system design for the module's overall assignment – the driverless car project. 
									These diagrams served as blueprints, guiding the development process and ensuring all aspects of the system were meticulously planned.<br>		
									<br>Pairing the knowledge gained from UML design, collaborative discussions, and Codio exercises, I was able to create an appropriate system design and implement it into a driverless car project. While the program did not achieve all the objectives I had initially set, the combination of theoretical understanding and technical skills acquired throughout this module enabled me to build a solid foundation. 
										This experience has equipped me with the confidence and ability to further develop and enhance the driverless car program in the future.<br>
									<br>Moreover, reflecting on the entire learning journey, I realized the importance of integrating different learning modes – theoretical study, practical application, and collaborative learning. 
										Each mode reinforced the other, creating a holistic learning experience that went beyond traditional classroom education. The theoretical aspects provided a solid foundation, the practical exercises offered hands-on experience, and the collaborative discussions facilitated peer learning and diverse perspectives.<br>
									<br>Looking ahead, I am excited about the possibilities that lie in further exploring and expanding my knowledge in object-oriented programming. 
										The skills and insights gained from this module have not only enhanced my understanding of OOP but also ignited a passion for continuous learning and improvement in this field. 
										I am eager to apply these concepts to more complex projects, pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve with object-oriented programming in Python and beyond.<br>

									<br>In conclusion, this module has been an enlightening journey, transforming my approach to programming and system design. The introduction to new concepts, the emphasis on UML, the practical exercises in Codio, and the collaborative discussions have collectively enriched my learning experience. 
										I am grateful for the knowledge and skills acquired and look forward to leveraging them in my future endeavors, confident in my ability to tackle complex programming challenges with a structured and informed approach.
